					<h1><b>CORN CAN'T RUN!</b></h1>
					<p><b>Did you know corn can't run? So once I applied to this job where I sell phones inside of a Walmart. I applied because my best friend worked there and she recommended the job to me. So once I started working there I met all sort of fun people. I was promoted a short time later from a mobile expert to a team lead. That's when I started talking to two other team leads Jesse and Matt. You see Jessee had been selling phones inside walmart for a long time and actually came form a previous company and Matt hadn't been there as long coming from actually working for Walmart.  Our boss Tiffany used to tell us to get out there and make that üåΩüçû So Matt changed his nickname in our group chat toüåΩüçû. So then we refer to Matt as corn in different ways. I.E. corn boy, Mr. Corn, etc... Then about 6 months later Matt gets promoted to district manager and doesn't sell phones nearly as often so one day he comes out and says he's running one (running in this case means he is filling out an application for a customer to get a phone not actually running with his legs). Then I decided to say &quot; didn't know corn could run?&quot; And you see this is funny because corn can't run as it is a vegetable not an animal. But soon after that Jessee responded with &quot;it can't run but it can stalk.&quot; And you see this was even funnier because corn grows in stalks. So now you know corn can't run it stalks.</b></p>
